# Sakila SQL Practice Project

This repository contains SQL queries practiced using the Sakila database. The queries cover a range of difficulties: easy, medium, and hard, based on real-world scenarios. Each query file includes comments explaining the logic and structure of the SQL used.

## Files
- `01_easy_queries.sql`: Easy queries to get familiar with basic SQL syntax.
- `02_medium_queries.sql`: Intermediate queries, using joins, aggregations, and conditions.
- `03_hard_queries.sql`: Advanced queries involving complex joins and optimizations.

## How to Run
1. Set up the Sakila database on your local machine.
2. Execute the SQL queries in your preferred SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
